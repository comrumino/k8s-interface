/*
Package names defines facilities to work with Kubernetes names

It lets clients validate, transform and process names that can be used in Kubernetes.
An example of such transformations would be transforming an Instance ID to a slug.
A slug is a human-readable, friendly representation of the full instance ID which is also designed to be compatible with Kubernetes conventions for resource names.
